This program checks the strength of a password based on common security rules. It evaluates whether the password has a minimum length and includes uppercase letters, 
lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Each condition adds to the overall strength score of the password.
Based on the total score, the password is classified as Weak, Medium, or Strong. 
This helps users understand how to create secure passwords and highlights the importance of strong authentication in cybersecurity.
